## Life After Death

👋 Welcome to "Life After Death", a survival game created during a Game Jam in collaboration with Nathan Catalan and Hugo Eschlimann. The goal of the game is simple: survive by using any means necessary. You will have to improve your powers on Earth and avoid dying in Hell. The time you will have on Earth will be limited to 40 seconds to a minute, while in Hell you will only have 15 to 30 seconds to survive.

🕰️ What you need to know about Game Jam:
A Game Jam is an event where video game developers come together to create a game in a limited amount of time, usually between 24 and 48 hours. Participants must design, develop and test their game in a very short period of time. The Game Jam encourages creativity, collaboration and problem solving.

🤝 We are delighted to present "Life After Death", our creation during the Game Jam. We hope you enjoy playing this game as much as we enjoyed creating it. Do not hesitate to send us your comments and your impressions!
